**Volunteer Tracking App**
Project-2 An app to track volunteer events attended

## Project 2 description

For this project I selected to write an app to track volunteer activities. When we volunteer we participate in many activities and tracking what we&#39;ve done is important.  The app allows us to create users, add events such as Days of Caring or STEM at the elementary schools.  Each event usually has many activities, so this app will allow you to add activities associated with the event, which is added to each users&#39; profile.
